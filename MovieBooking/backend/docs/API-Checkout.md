# Checkout API Documentation

Base Path: `/checkout`

## Overview
Atomic checkout endpoint combining booking confirmation and payment initiation in a single transaction.
Supports **session-based guest checkout** - authenticated users use JWT, guests use X-Session-Id header.

---

## Checkout Flow Advantage

### Traditional Two-Step Flow
1. Confirm booking → `/bookings/confirm`
2. Initiate payment → `/payments/order`
**Risk**: If payment initiation fails, booking exists in PENDING_PAYMENT state

### Atomic Checkout Flow ✅
1. Checkout → `/checkout` (confirms booking + initiates payment atomically)
**Benefit**: If payment initiation fails, booking is never created (transaction rollback)

---

## Endpoint

### Confirm Booking and Initiate Payment (Atomic)
**POST** `/checkout`

Atomically validates seat locks, creates a pending booking, and initiates payment. If payment initiation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

## Process Flow

### 1. Validation Phase
- Verifies session has locked seats for the showtime
- Validates seat locks haven't expired
- Confirms all locked seats still valid
- Validates promotion code (if provided, registered users only)
- For guests: validates guestInfo provided

### 2. Booking Creation Phase
- For guests: Creates User account with role=GUEST using guestInfo
- Creates booking with status `PENDING_PAYMENT`
- **Applies membership tier discount** (for authenticated users with a membership tier)
- Applies promotion code discount (if provided, registered users only)
- Calculates total amount with combined discounts
- Transitions seats from `LOCKED` to `BOOKED`
- Associates promotion code with booking (if applicable)

#### Discount Calculation
Discounts are calculated using the same shared logic as the price preview endpoint, ensuring consistency between preview and actual charges:
1. **Membership Tier Discount**: Automatically applied for authenticated users based on their membership tier (e.g., Silver 5%, Gold 10%, Platinum 15%)
2. **Promotion Code Discount**: Applied if a valid promotion code is provided

Both discounts are calculated on the subtotal and combined for the final discount amount.

### 3. Payment Initiation Phase
- Creates payment record with status `PENDING`
- Initiates payment with selected gateway (PayPal or Momo)
- Converts currency if needed (VND → USD for PayPal)
- Stores exchange rate and gateway amounts

### 4. Rollback on Failure
- If payment initiation fails, entire transaction is rolled back
- Booking is not created
- Seats remain in `LOCKED` state
- User can retry or seats will auto-release after timeout

---

## Example Usage

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// After user selects seats and confirms details
async function checkout(lockId, promotionCode, paymentMethod, guestInfo = null) {
  try {
    const headers = isAuthenticated
      ? { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
      : { 'X-Session-Id': sessionId };
      
    const body = {
      lockId,
      promotionCode, // optional, ignored for guests
      paymentMethod, // 'PAYPAL' or 'MOMO'
      ...(guestInfo && { guestInfo }) // include for guests
    };
    
    const response = await fetch('/checkout', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        ...headers,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(body)
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Checkout failed');
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Store booking ID for later reference
    localStorage.setItem('pendingBookingId', data.bookingId);
    
    // Redirect to payment gateway
    window.location.href = data.redirectUrl;
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Checkout error:', error);
    // Show error message to user
    // Seats remain locked, user can retry
  }
}
```

### After Payment Return
```javascript
// User returns from payment gateway
// See Payment API documentation for capture flow
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const transactionId = urlParams.get('token') || urlParams.get('orderId');
const paymentMethod = urlParams.get('token') ? 'PAYPAL' : 'MOMO';

// Confirm payment
const response = await fetch('/payments/order/capture', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    transactionId: transactionId,
    paymentMethod: paymentMethod
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
// Handle success or failure
```

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56.789+00:00",
  "message": "Seat locks expired or invalid",
  "details": "uri=/checkout"
}
```

**Common Causes:**
- Seat locks expired (older than 10 minutes)
- No seats locked for this showtime
- Invalid promotion code
- Guest users attempting to use promotion codes
- Invalid payment method
- Invalid snack IDs
- Missing or invalid X-Session-Id header (guests)
- Missing guestInfo for guest checkout
- Email already exists (guest registration)sts (guest registration)

### 401 Unauthorized

{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56.789+00:00",
  "message": "Unauthorized: Invalid or missing authentication",
  "details": "uri=/checkout"
}
```

**Causes:**
- Missing both JWT token and X-Session-Id header
- Invalid JWT token
- Malformed X-Session-Id (must be UUID)

### 409 Conflict
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56.789+00:00",
  "message": "One or more seats are no longer available",
  "details": "uri=/checkout"
}
```

**Causes:**
- Race condition: seats locked by session but booked by another (rare)
- Email already exists (guest registration)

### 410 Gone
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56.789+00:00",
  "message": "Seat lock has expired",
  "details": "uri=/checkout"
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56.789+00:00",
  "message": "Failed to initiate payment with PayPal/Momo",
  "details": "uri=/checkout"
}
```

**Cause:**
- Payment gateway communication failure
- Transaction is rolled back automatically
- Booking is not created
- Seats remain locked for retry

---

## Comparison: Checkout vs Traditional Flow

### Traditional Flow (Two-Step)
**Pros:**
- More granular control
- Can create booking without immediate payment

**Cons:**
- Risk of orphaned bookings in PENDING_PAYMENT state
- Requires manual cleanup of failed payment initiations
- More API calls

### Atomic Checkout (One-Step) ✅
**Pros:**
- Atomic transaction guarantees consistency
- No orphaned bookings
- Single API call
- Automatic rollback on failure

**Cons:**
- Less flexible for special payment flows
- All-or-nothing (can't retry payment without re-booking)

**Recommended**: Use atomic checkout for standard user flow.

---

## Important Notes

1. **Transaction Atomicity**: If payment initiation fails, booking is NOT created (rollback).

2. **Session Requirement**: Session must have active seat locks. Extracted from JWT or X-Session-Id header.

3. **Lock Expiration**: If locks expire during checkout, request fails with 400 error.

4. **Guest User Creation**: Guest User accounts created during checkout with role=GUEST. Email must be unique.

5. **Promotion Codes**: Only for registered users. Guests cannot use promotions.

6. **Currency Conversion**: PayPal amounts converted VND → USD using cached exchange rates.

7. **Payment Timeout**: User has 15 minutes to complete payment on gateway.

8. **Retry Logic**: On gateway error, user can retry. Seats remain locked until timeout.

9. **Session Management**:
   - Authenticated: JWT provides userId
   - Guest: X-Session-Id header must match lock session
   - Frontend must persist guest session ID (localStorage)

10. **Status Transitions**:
    - Seats: LOCKED → BOOKED (on success)
    - Booking: Created with PENDING_PAYMENT
    - Payment: Created with PENDING
    - After capture: Booking → CONFIRMED, Payment → COMPLETED
